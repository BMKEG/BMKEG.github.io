Here is a Confluence template for the evaluation of BIRN Capabilities based on BIRN Technical Readiness Levels. 

Copy and paste this page into your wiki space and use it to evaluate the technical readiness level of your work according to CMMI-DEV 1.3 criteria (developed by the Operations WG).

h3. Concept

|   | The use cases for the capability are explicitly documented. (A “use case” is a specific activity that the capability performs for a specific user in a specific environment.)|
|   | A chartered BIRN working group owns the capability.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability includes relevant user representatives.|
|   | The capability is periodically presented/reviewed in the BIRN steering committee.|
|   | The capability is covered by the annual BIRN project plan and progress report.|
|   | The capability is included in activities with prospective users (engagement meetings, user surveys, etc.).|
|   | The BIRN annual progress report covers the performance of the capability relative to previously published plans.|
|   | Notes from relevant steering committee reviews and working group meetings are available.|
|   | Decisions regarding the capability’s development schedule and resource assignments are explicitly recorded.|

h3. Prototype

|   | The working group that owns the capability has documented quality requirements for the capability. (E.g., performance, stability, reliability, sustainability, ease of use.)|
|   | All code and supporting documents for the capability (manuals, design docs, etc.) are stored in a source repository.|
|   | The development team limits where requirements and changes to requirements may come from.|
|   | The development team uses an objective set of criteria for evaluating and approving requirements.|
|   | The development team builds a list of alternate implementations for the capability and compares the options side-by-side.|
|   | The development team provides a user’s manual for the capability.|
|   | The development team provides descriptive information, text, or other materials to the steering committee.|
|   | The development team maintains an environment in which the end-to-end capability can be seen and tested. (Testbed, demo platform, etc.)|
|   | The development team documents the critical interfaces and version dependencies between the components that implement the capability.|
|   | The development team maintains a list of tasks (WBS or backlog) in a shared location. (E.g., a Wiki or a Jira instance).|
|   | The development team maintains a project schedule with assignments, estimates, work completed in a shared location. (E.g., Wiki, Jira, shared doc.)|
|   | The steering committee and the working group that owns the capability maintain an explicit list of decisions/reports/goals that will require metrics data.|
|   | The operations working group produces and records capability readiness assessment when requested.|
|   | Changes in readiness levels are monitored and recorded in notes by the steering committee.|

h1. Limited availability

|   | The working group that owns the capability has established specific success criteria for the capability in an end user deployment.|
|   | The development team stores and tracks the status of the capability’s requirements in a tracking system or database. 
|   | The working group that owns the capability maintains the traceability (relationship) between end user requirements and technical capability requirements.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability ensures the consistency between capability development activities and current requirements.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability conducts periodic status reviews with major stakeholders, including reviewing the development plan/schedule.|
|   | The development team documents the capability’s design/architecture.|
|   | The development team provides a specific place where the implemented capability is available to others. (E.g., a repository, hosted service, download site.)|
|   | The development team provides an operator’s manual for the capability.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability acts in coordination with other relevant working groups. – needs to be clarified, emphasis on joint planning/coherency from user perspective|
|   | The capability is integrated with services and interfaces from other capabilities. (E.g., security, data movement.)|
|   | The development team has a commit policy that states when things must be committed.|
|   | The development team generates all releases from the contents of the source repository.|
|   | The development team maintains a record of all bug reports and resolutions per version.|
|   | The development team maintains a record of all changes to the capability.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability has evaluated the ability of any third party suppliers to satisfy the capability’s requirements.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability has reviewed the supplier licenses and use agreements for any third-party components used in the capability.|
|   | The development team maintains a test suite for the capability that covers each of the capability’s requirements.|
|   | The development team executes component test suites routinely and reports its own bugs.|
|   | The development team conducts some form of peer review on the components(s) that implement the capability.|
|   | The development team has a process for coordinating handoffs between the development of individual components and the capability integration activity.|
|   | The development team has produced all of the packages for delivery and/or established the operational agreements for capability hosting.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability maintains a traceability matrix between specific usage and quality measurements (data collection) and the reporting/decision needs that they satisfy.|
|   | Data collection and reporting tasks (e.g., usage reports) are explicitly covered in the capability’s project plan(s).|
|   | The working group that owns the capability has established a help desk function for the capability.|

h1. General availability

|   | Representative end users have validated the capability’s use cases, quality requirements, and success criteria.|
|   | The development team provides a maintenance manual for the capability.|
|   | The development team provides user-training materials for the capability.
|   | The development team maintains a test environment in which the capability’s test suite can be run in a controlled manner.|
|   | The development team executes the capability’s test suite in the test environment on a regular basis and documents the results. (E.g., test report, new Jira entries.)|
|   | Representative end users have deployed the capability in an environment that matches the original use cases. (A “validation environment.”)|
|   | The working group that owns the capability has observed the capability working in the validation environment and reported on the results.|
|   | The development team maintains a record or database of all change requests per version.|
|   | When metrics data is shared beyond the development team, it is placed in a context that makes it relevant to the recipients’ needs.|
|   | The working group that owns the capability has documented the typical/critical help desk functions|
