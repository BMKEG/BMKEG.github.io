		<p>BMKEG is an academically-funded, applied computer science research group. We 
		take cutting-edge computer science (CS) research in the field of artificial intelligence 
		and apply it to biomedicine across multiple fields based on requirements of end-users.
		Our focus is on the development of practical tools that may be used by knowledge 
		workers <i>in their everyday work</i>. We work in collaboration with 
		specialized CS researchers to find innovative ways of applying their work within
		practical software tools.</p>

        <p>We are an <a href="http://www.isi.edu/research_groups/bmkeg">open source, biomedical informatics software development shop</a>, funded from academic sources with a strong commitment to develop practical knowledge engineering systems to assist and support biomedical scientists in their everyday work. </p> 
        <p>Here we describe the software currently being developed and actively maintained in our GitHub repositories for <em>end users</em>. So, you will find user manuals, walkthroughs, simplified installation instructions and everything we think you might need to install and run our code easily out of the box. Our main GitHub page has lots of information for developers, so if you want to dive into the code itself, you should read this <a href="https://github.com/BMKEG">guide to our codebase</a>.</p> 
        <h1>Projects </h1>
        <h2>The SciKnowMine Triage System</h2>
        <p>A web application that permit biocurators to manage collections of scientific articles 
        and to accelerate the process of `docutment triage' (sorting them into categories of 
        interest for subsequent detailed curation).</p>

        </div>
        <h2>The Layout Aware PDF Text Extraction System</h2>
        <p>A low-level java library for accurately extracting text from PDF files and 
        additional web-based tools to improve performance of the text extraction.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design</h2>
        <p>A general-purpose, ontology-aware knowledge engineering methodology for 
        biomedical data that permits the construction of biomedical databases derived 
        only from a description of the underlying experimental protocol used to gather 
        the data.</p>

        <h2>The View Primitive Data Model framework</h2>
        <p>A system scaffolding set of java-libraries that permit the agile development of 
        web-applications. This is the foundation for all of our software tools and 
        permits us to develop specialized database applications for scientists rapidly and 
        efficiently.</p>
